# Empirical evaluation of SAG for ROS
This repository contains the code used to create the experiments used in the Empirical evaluation section of an
upcoming paper that analyzes the ROS2 Executor using Schedule Abstraction Graphs (SAG).

The upcoming paper is:
- R.L. Radulescu, J. Lap, and M. Nasri, “[Response-Time Analysis of the ROS2 Executor using Schedule Abstraction Graphs]”,
*Proceedings of the 37th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2025)*, to appear

This paper is heavily based on the following paper, that you can read to understand the Schedule Abstraction Graph:
- M. Nasri, G. Nelissen, and B. Brandenburg, “[Response-Time Analysis of Limited-Preemptive Parallel DAG Tasks under Global Scheduling](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol133-ecrts2019/LIPIcs.ECRTS.2019.21/LIPIcs.ECRTS.2019.21.pdf)”, *Proceedings of the 31st Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2019)*, pp. 21:1–21:23, July 2019.
