Firstly, the Execution Time values shown in the case study figure, i.e., Fig 4,
are NOT the Execution Time values used in the analysis that produces the MT2:WCRT in Fig. 5(a) !!!!!! 
The values from Fig. 4 are wrong!!!

Secondly, the MORT values are taken literally from the plot:
- I zoomed in on the plot
- I measured how many pixels represent 50 on the y-axis
- I measured how many pixels each MORT bar has
- I used the simple rule of three to get the MORT values in ms
- So, the MORT values that I calculated from the plot are NOT the *actual* MORT measured values
